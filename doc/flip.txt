*flip.txt*                           Quick navigation between file counterparts.
==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION
Flip enables quick navigation between counterparts of the current file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONFIGURATION                                                     *flip.options*
Flip supports the following options:
                                                            *flip.options.paths*
    paths: ~
      A list of paths to search for potential counterparts. Non-absolute paths
      are considered relative to the directory containing the current file.
      Flip will always search the directory of the current file in addition to
      any directories specified here.

      The default value is an empty list.

                                                 *flip.options.exclude_patterns*
    exclude_patterns: ~
      A set of regular expressions that define files that should always be
      excluded from the counterpart set. Any file path that matches any of the
      provided expressions will never be considered a counterpart.

      |string.match()| is used to perform the matching; see |luaref-patterns|
      for details on pattern syntax.

      The default value is an empty list.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS                                                         *flip.commands*
`:Flip {command}`

  command    action
  -------    ------
  next       Cycle to the next counterpart in the counterpart list.
  prior      Cycle to the prior counterpart in the counterpart list.

If {command} is not specified, Flip will assume `next`.

Flip will try to switch to a window containing the counterpart first. If no
window exists, Flip will open the counterpart file using the `:edit` command.
